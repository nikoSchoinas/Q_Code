# Q_Code
Quantum Coding

The repository consists of Python scripts that they were implemented using Qiskit package.
It is an introduction to quantum computing as many of the most fundamental algorithms are implemented. 
Comments are as important as the actual code.  
Qiskit supports Python 3.5 or later.
Originally, the scripts were written in Jupyter Notebook but this repository contains only .py files.
